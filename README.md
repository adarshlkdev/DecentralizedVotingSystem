#DecentralizedVotingSystem
Decentralized Voting System using Ethereum blockchain in solidity


Blockchain is a technology that is rapidly gaining momentum in era of industry 4.0. With high security and transparency provisions, it is being widely used in supply chain management systems, healthcare, payments, business, IoT, voting systems, etc. 

Why do we need it? 
Current voting systems like ballot box voting or electronic voting suffer from various security threats such as DDoS attacks, polling booth capturing, vote alteration and manipulation, malware attacks, etc, and also require huge amounts of paperwork, human resources, and time. This creates a sense of distrust among existing systems. 
Some of the disadvantages are:

Long Queues during elections.
Security Breaches like data leaks, vote tampering.
Lot of paperwork involved, hence less eco-friendly and time-consuming.
Difficult for differently-abled voters to reach polling booth.
Cost of expenditure on elections is high.
Solution: 
Using blockchain, voting process can be made more secure, transparent, immutable, and reliable. How? Let’s take an example. 

Suppose you are an eligible voter who goes to polling booth and cast vote using EVM (Electronic Voting Machine). But since it’s a circuitry after all and if someone tampers with microchip, you may never know that did your vote reach to person for whom you voted or was diverted into another candidate’s account? 
Since there’s no tracing back of your vote. But, if you use blockchain- it stores everything as a transaction that will be explained soon below; and hence gives you a receipt of your vote (in a form of a transaction ID) and you can use it to ensure that your vote has been counted securely
